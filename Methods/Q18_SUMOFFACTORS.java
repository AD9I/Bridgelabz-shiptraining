// Create a program to find the factors of a number taken as user input, store the factors in an array, and display the factors. Also, find the sum, sum of square of factors and product of the factors and display the results Hint => 1. Take the input for a number 2. Write a static method to find the factors of the number and save them in an array and return the array. 3. To find factors and save to array will have two loops. The first loop is to find the count and initialize the array with the count. The second loop saves the factors into the array 4. Write a method to find the sum of the factors using factors array 5. Write a method to find the product of the factors using factors array 6. Write a method to find the sum of squares of the factors using Math.pow() method
